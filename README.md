# Functional specs
The idea for this application is a service for recommending and sharing music with friends and other people. The primary view for the app is a feed, kind of like a twitter feed, where users can publish posts. These posts consist of song recommendations.
It is possible to add comments to the posts and also some form of like-button will be present.

Each user will have a profile, and in this profile the user can add his or her favorite genre. The user is able to log in through creating an account or using a Google account.

The Spotify web API is used to provide search functionality and to display songs in the feed.

## Frameworks
The application is using the MERN stack, i.e. the frameworks MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. This is convenient as JavaScript can is used through the whole application.
